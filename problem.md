Talking about money is hard. As soon as we start thinking about numbers and doing math in our heads, it gets complicated and intimidating. Embarrassment and fear of judgement prevent many of us from having a deep (yet sometimes very necessary) conversation about our finances with a spouse, family, roommates, or friends. Even if we do manage to get over these emotional hurdles and have the conversation, the feedback we receive can be biased, incomplete or just plain bad. After all, they aren't financial experts.

Most Americans won't talk to a professional financial advisor because they believe they don't have enough wealth, and they wouldn't qualify for a professional's help. Bad press in recent years has led to some trust issues for the financial industry. For the "little" financial decisions in life, many of us believe we don't need a professional's advice even though the little things we buy on a credit card or finance with "no money down" can add up to become big problems down the road. Compound interest is a powerful force!

The truth is there are a lot of misconceptions about how money works and how we should handle our finances to achieve our goals. Unless we talk things through and learn from each other, our money troubles won't go away and will continue to put our most valued personal relationships at risk.
