### Money Talk
Math shouldn’t get in the way of you talking about money with your significant other, family, roommate, or friends. When we don’t deal with our financial problems, it leads to avoiding conversations and putting our most valued personal relationships at risk. [Read more](problem.html) 

### Money Math Done For You
Our vision is for MoneyStack to be **the first place you go** to kick-off a money-related conversation. You’ll get answers to your questions, learn how the math and numbers work, and gain confidence in your understanding of your financial situation.  This way, you can talk to the most important people in your life and make sound financial decisions together. MoneyStack achieves this goal by delivering a virtual assistant for personal finance and by providing you with a private online collaboration workspace.

### Virtual Assistant for Personal Finance
MoneyStack is your personal financial assistant. It crunches the numbers for you and answers money math questions in plain language. It’s available on the Web, on iOS and Android devices, on Alexa and Google Assistant, on chat platforms like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, and via telephone and text. MoneyStack is right there with you to help you when you’re thinking (or talking) about money at home, in your car, at the office, on the bus, at school, at the beach, out shopping, walking the dog... I think you get what we’re saying; MoneyStack is available everywhere.

### Online Collaboration Workspace
MoneyStack is more than just a smart personal virtual assistant. It’s also a platform for online collaboration where you can review all of your money questions and answers, play with your numbers, work on ‘what-if’ scenarios, and invite people in your inner circle to join you. If you want feedback from anyone outside your circle, you can safely share your worksheets on social media and in popular personal finance forums like Reddit Personal Finance, Quora, and others.

### How We Make Money
MoneyStack won’t clutter your worksheets with ads for credit cards or other irrelevant financial products. If MoneyStack does include ads eventually, they’ll be “native” and designed to improve the overall user experience (for example, an non-intrusive link to an advertiser’s Website to look up current mortgage rates). We won’t sell or rent your information to advertisers and 3rd-parties because we value your privacy and the financial information you entrust to us. MoneyStack is built from the ground-up using state-of-the-art, Bank-level security so that your information is secure. There will be a subscription fee of around $10/mo for private workspaces, but you can invite any number of people in your household to join for free. MoneyStack will also partner with a select few vetted and credentialed financial advisors whom you can invite into your workspace to collaborate with you. There will be a different monthly subscription fee for financial professionals.
