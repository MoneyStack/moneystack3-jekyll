### What is MoneyStack?
{{site.description}} {{site.description2}}

### Collaborate Online
MoneyStack is designed from the ground-up to make it easy and safe to collaborate with other people in your workspace. That makes it easier for you and your significant other (or anyone else for that matter) to get on the same page and build plans together. 

### Public or Private Worksheets
You build financial plans and "what-if" scenarios in worksheets. Worksheets are private by default. If you want to ask a personal finance question on Reddit or explain an idea in a blog post, you can set your worksheet to be public and embed it in your post.

### "Fork" Someone Else's Worksheet
Inspired by how software developers share code to learn from each other, when you see a public MoneyStack worksheet anywhere on the Web (e.g. blogs, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter), you can "fork" it (a fancy way to say copy) and make it your own. Set your version to ‘private’, plug in your own numbers, and customize the plan for your needs.

### Accessible (and actually useful) Everywhere
You can use MoneyStack on the Web and on your smartphone, and you can also talk to it using a Alexa or Google Assistant, and chat with it on Facebook Messenger and Text. Build a worksheet on the Web and then, "Alexa, ask MoneyStack …" your questions about your "what-if" scenario from your living room… it’s like having a smart money advisor with you everywhere you go.

### Bank-level Security
We’re serious about security, and use state-of-the-art technology to encrypt and protect your information. 

### No Intrusive Ads
MoneyStack isn’t cluttered with banner ads and "recommendations" for credit cards like many of our competitors. We may link to partners on the Web to lookup interest rates or other information to enhance your user experience, and we may be compensated by those partners when you click one of those links, but we promise two things: (1) we will clearly disclose our relationship, (2) we won’t share your information with partners without your permission.
